                There is growing interest across the University of Toronto (U of T) community in using data to inform and enhance activities related to the teaching and learning mission of 
                the university. These include pedagogical enhancement and innovation within course and program contexts, academic success support at the program and degree levels, potential 
                tools and resources that may support students in their learning journey, and strategic decision-making for the institution.

            <ul>
              <li>Prior to joining the Digital Learning Innovations department, significant research has been done. You can read the paper 
                <a href="https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/275/2021/07/Revised-Learning-Analytics-Green-Paper.pdf>">here</a>. 
                So there were already a website structure that I was going to be working with. But I was interested in knowing whether the website architecture was user friendly or not</li>
              <li>I end up choosing tree testing using 
                <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=search_usca_brand&keyword=optimal%20workshop&matchtype=b&network=g&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlC46tfOQWn50GooLrHc3tT_sYuCl2HQxFdbnM1XbqUiLoT2DkPGlELxoCy1gQAvD_BwE">Optimal Workshop</a>. 
                Tree testing allows users to choose where they think they can locate a certain piece of information from the website, and Optimal Workshop can track data like first click, time spent on answering question, success rate etc. 
              </li>
              <li>We were able to recruit over 20 participants from administrative staffs and faculty staffs from various department at UofT. 
                Using the result from tree testing, we found out that the original website architecture are fairly user friendly with a few exceptions. 
                We made some changes in the labels of our navigation links and moved on to the next stage</li>

                  <li>Because the functionality of the website were fairly intense, we split the group into 3 cohorts randomly. </li>
                  <li>The study was conducted and recorded via Microsoft Teams call in a 1-on-1 interview format, we gave our participants 3-4 tasks to complete, 
                    and each group gets a different set of task so we could test every single functionality without causing fatigue to our user. Each session was around 30 min long and the study were conducted from May 15th to June 9th.</li>
                  <li>A questionnaire was given to our participants after they complete the task to gather additional thoughts and feedbacks</li>
                  <li><strong>Fun fact:</strong>Because many of our participants are instructors at UofT, a few of the professors were actually my old CS profs. It was quite the experience to be 
                  working with my professor, this had to be the most exciting part of the job.</li>

          <div class="col-12">
            <p>Overall, this was a great opportunity for me to showcase my UX design skills. Although not a complete UX journey from idea to product, I still manage to apply most of the core 
              steps in a UX study, including user research, UI design and usability testing. I was also able to bring my perspective as a student and to be able to work with professors at UofT was 
              quite the honor. Knowing the fact that my work, no matter how indirect it was, was contributing towards the success of student is something that I felt related and proud of.
