            <h3>Sprint 3: Prototyping</h3>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-12">
  
              <ul>
                <li>After knowing what we going to do, here comes my favorite part, creating the prototype.</li>
                <li>For our lo-fi prototype, we created an time management app with avatar customizing game. The idea was to have users earn rewards by complete their task to buy skins for their avatar.
                   but sadly, most of the people we asked to review the prototype did not like the idea of the game. Many people felt like it was childish. So we had to abandon the plan  &#128546; </li>
                <li> <strong> Funny story,</strong> so I was doubting the game idea during the sprint. I too didn't find avatar game was appealing. My suggestion was to do something like a complete your task for charity.
                  But my crew convinced me to work on the game. Lesson here is when you truly believe something won't work, do your best to convince others, don't give up your own idea just because the majority wins. 
                </li>
                <li>We used Balsamiq to create our mid-fi, and my job during this sprint was to create a story board.</li>
                <li>The App will allow users to have a personalized schedule generated for them by linking to their student account. The app will then generate study sessions based on 
                  an estimated number of hour the task will take and ensure user have an healthy schedule.

                  <li>We asked them few questions after the testing sessions for feedbacks on the project. </li>
                  <li>We gathered these feedbacks and wrote a list of features and changes we will make in the future.</li>
                  <li>I gathered 2 of my friends for the testing session. I wasn't sure if they were being nice to me, but they refuse to give me anything too negative despite I gave them the 
                    permission to fully blast us. So another lesson here is avoid having your friends coming to your testing sessions because most likely they're bias.

          <div class="col-12">
            <p>Overall, I'm very proud of what we accomplished here. Despite there's a few hiccups here and there, and something we still need to figure out like how we are going to be estimating 
              how much time we will allocate for study sessions. My teammates are all talented creative individuals who I'm sure will succeed in this industry. This class has gave me a hands on experience of what
              UX designer do, and I really had a fun time working with my team. The number 1 thing I wish we could change was, having user testing sessions with our other colleagues in the class, it would have
              pushed me out of my comfort zone and improve both my interview skills and UX testing skills. As for me personally, I didn't get to design the prototype which was something I wanted to do
              because it is more on the technical side. But other skills I gained in the class like user research, persona building and ux testing, it will definitely be a part of my journey of becoming an UX designer.</p>
